## Welcome to Phobos

![ ](assets/images/title.png)

Phobos is a two-player co-op, action-adventure that pulls you into the depths of a hostile, alien ocean. One player has been kidnapped while the other is in a desperate chase to save their partner. Both players must work in perfect harmony, outmaneuvering a series of escalating threats through flawless communication, coordination, and trust. Brace yourself for a pulse-pounding pursuit that keeps you on the edge of your seat, delivering heart-racing moments of triumph only possible when teamwork takes center stage.
